# Baseline
Emerging water crisis is one of the biggest challenges that are being faced by the society which requires collective effort from state and citizen to ensure sustainable use of water resources.  We believe in **strengthening water democracy** by creating actionable knowledge from local data empower citizen from data they trust and strengthen large data sets for better decisions. 

Baseline is an integrated monitoring and information system that provides information on five critical aspects of water resources from the communities.
